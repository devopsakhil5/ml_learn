Fantastic! I'm glad to hear that a simple restart of the kernel did the trick. It's one of those surprisingly common solutions in the world of development environments.
Sometimes the environment needs a little nudge to recognize new files or changes. Happy coding, and feel free to reach out if you encounter any more hurdles!
Sometimes, Jupyter notebooks can have issues with recognizing newly created files or changes in the file system. Try restarting the kernel of your notebook. You can usually do this from the "Kernel" menu in the Jupyter interface (e.g., "Kernel" -> "Restart"). After restarting, try running the import statement again.
4. Check for Other Files Named mul.py:
It's less likely in this scenario, but sometimes there might be another file named mul.py in a different location that Python is finding instead. If you have a complex Python environment, this could potentially cause issues. However, given your description of the folder structure, this is probably not the case here.
Let's assume your mul.py file should contain the multiply function. Here's a checklist for you:
[ ] Is there a file named exactly mul.py inside the folder named exactly mymodu?
[ ] Inside mul.py, is there a function defined as def multiply(a, b):?
[ ] Are there any typos in the function name multiply in mul.py?
[ ] Have you restarted the Jupyter kernel since creating mymodu and mul.py?
Once you've gone through these checks, try running the import statement again. If you still get the error, please share the exact content of your mul.py file (you can copy and paste the code here), and we can take a closer look.
restarting helped, thanx

Happy coding, and feel free to reach out if you encounter any more hurdles!Okay, the ImportError: cannot import name 'multiply' from 'mymodu.mul' tells us that Python is finding the mymodu/mul.py file, but it's not finding something named multiply inside that file that it can import.
Let's systematically troubleshoot this:
1. Double-Check the mul.py File:
Content: Open the mul.py file located in your mymodu folder. Carefully examine its contents.
Function Definition: Make absolutely sure that you have defined a function named exactly multiply within that file. Python is case-sensitive, so Multiply, mUltiply, etc., will not be recognized as multiply.
Syntax: Ensure the function definition has the
